      <div class="content-about">
      <p>I am a software engineer currently serving the Columbus, OH area. After apending many years in the emergency medical field I have found my passion in programming. I have a love for front-end development and enjoy watching my creativity and passion for design come to life. I am a believer in second chances, hard work, determantaion and have a true desire to make the world just a little prettier. In my spare time I enjoy writing, and being outdoors.
