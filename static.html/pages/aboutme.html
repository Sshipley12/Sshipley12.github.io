    My Story...... Hello, I'm Stephanie and I am a full stack web developer with
    a passion for design. I grew up in a small town in Southern Ohio where I
    entered the demanding, rewarding field of Emergency Medical Services. After
    a few years, I decided to switch gears into the programming world. As
    challenging as it was, That has allowed me to showcase my creavity and
    problem solving skills in a completely new light. Some hobbies of mine
    include, spending time with family, blaring country music and searching for
    my keys.
