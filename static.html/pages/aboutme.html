    Welcome to my portiflio! I assume you're here because you want to learn a
    little more about me. So let's get started! My name is Stephanie and I am a
    full stack web developer with a passion for design. I grew up in a small
    town in Southern Ohio where I entered the demanding, rewarding field of
    Emergency Medical Services. After a few years, I decided to switch gears
    into the programming world (I figured computers can not throw things at
    you!). Some of my passions include, learning new things, defying odds,
    pushing personal boundries, shattering comfront zones and living by the
    qoute "It is never to late to be what you might have been"! My hobbies
    include arguing with a toddler to wear pants, searching for my keys and
    spending way to much money at Starbucks.
